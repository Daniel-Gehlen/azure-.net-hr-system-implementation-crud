**Technical Report: HR System Implementation**

**Overview:**
The HR System is a web-based application developed using the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on employee records and maintains logs of any changes made to employee data. The system is built using .NET Core and utilizes Azure services such as Azure SQL Database for relational data storage and Azure Table Storage for logging.

```

**Requirements Implemented:**

1. **CRUD Operations:**
   - Implemented Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for employee records using ASP.NET Core Web API.
   - Endpoints:
     - GET /api/Employee/{id}
     - PUT /api/Employee/{id}
     - DELETE /api/Employee/{id}
     - POST /api/Employee

2. **Employee and EmployeeLog Models:**
   - Defined `Employee` and `EmployeeLog` models to represent employee data and logs of employee modifications.
   - EmployeeLog inherits from Employee to capture the same information along with modification details.

3. **Azure Integration:**
   - Utilized Azure App Service for hosting the Web API.
   - Employed Azure SQL Database to store employee records.
   - Implemented Azure Table Storage to store logs of employee modifications.

4. **Data Access:**
   - Created `HRDbContext` class to manage database interactions using Entity Framework Core.
   - Implemented database migrations for initial setup and future updates.

5. **Service Layer:**
   - Developed `EmployeeService` to handle business logic for employee CRUD operations.
   - Implemented `EmployeeLogService` to manage logging of employee modifications.

6. **API Controller:**
   - Implemented `EmployeeController` to handle HTTP requests for employee operations.
   - Provided endpoints for each CRUD operation as per specifications.

7. **Azure Table Storage Service:**
   - Developed `EmployeeLogTableService` to interact with Azure Table Storage for logging employee modifications.
   - Implemented methods for inserting, querying, updating, and deleting logs.

**Project Structure:**
- Organized project into directories:
  - `Controllers`: Contains API controller for handling HTTP requests.
  - `Models`: Holds data models for employees and logs.
  - `Services`: Includes business logic services for employees and logs.
  - `DataAccess`: Manages database context and migrations.
  - `Azure/TableStorage`: Houses services related to Azure Table Storage.
- Configuration stored in `appsettings.json`.

**Conclusion:**
The HR System successfully meets the specified requirements by providing a robust solution for managing employee data and logging changes. Leveraging Azure services ensures scalability, reliability, and security of the application. The project follows best practices in software development and Azure integration, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements and maintenance.

This technical report summarizes the key aspects of the HR System implementation, demonstrating compliance with requirements and effective utilization of technologies.
